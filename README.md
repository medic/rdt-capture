# Overview
RDTScan is an open-source library for developers who are interested in creating Android apps that support the digital curation and interpretation of [rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_diagnostic_test). RDTScan provides the following functionality:

**1. Real-Time Quality Checking During Image Capture**  
RDTScan uses image processing to check the quality of images intercepted from the smartphone's camera while the user moves their smartphone over the RDT. RDTScan provides functions for checking the blurriness and lighting of incoming camera frames. If the image is in the camera's field-of-view, RDTScan also checks the scale and orientation of the RDT in the image. To help end-users capture the clearest image possible, RDTScan intelligently generates instructions based on these quality checks.

**2. Robust Result Interpretation**  
Assuming a suitable image has been captured, RDTScan can post-process the image to emphasize any faint lines that may appear on the immunoassay. The end-user can view the post-processed image for themselves to make a more informed decision about the RDT results. Alternatively, RDTScan provides a lightweight algorithm that interprets the test results on the end-user's behalf.

RDTScan uses a feature-matching approach for RDT recognition, allowing RDTScan to be quickly adapted to new RDT designs. Unlike model-driven approaches that require a dataset of example images for model training, RDTScan only requires a single example image and some additional metadata (e.g., relative position and meaning of each line) to detect and interpret RDTs. RDTScan is intentially designed so that all of the algorithms can run on the smartphone, which means that there is no need to upload confidential photos to a server to use this library.

**Disclaimers:** 
* Although RDTScan has been tested through multiple in-lab studies and real-world deployments, this library has not been FDA-approved.
* This library requires that target smartphone's support Android's [Camera2 API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary), which supports control over the camera's hardware.

# Installation
RDTScan utilizes [OpenCV for Android](https://opencv.org/android/) for many of the image processing steps, which in turn relies on Android's [Native Development Kit (NDK)](https://developer.android.com/ndk/). Therefore, it is beyond the scope of the current project to export RDTScan's functionality as a `.jar` file. Instead, there are two options for getting started with RDTScan:
* **No existing project:** If you are making a smartphone app from scratch, you can simply clone the repository directly and build your app on top of what has already been provided. This repository has all of the dependencies properly configured along with a fully-functioning app that developers can use to get started.
* **Existing project:** If you have a smartphone app that has already been made and you are looking to add RDTScan to it, you will still need to add OpenCV for Android to your project. The [official tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/android_binary_package/O4A_SDK.html) for doing this is fairly outdated, but there are plenty of other tutorials out there depending on your environment. Once you have done that, copy the following folders and files to your project (at the same path):
  * [`src/.../core/*`](app/src/main/java/edu/washington/cs/ubicomplab/rdt_reader/core)
  * [`src/.../utils/*`](app/src/main/java/edu/washington/cs/ubicomplab/rdt_reader/utils)
  * [`src/.../views/*`](app/src/main/java/edu/washington/cs/ubicomplab/rdt_reader/views)
  * [`assets/config.json`](app/src/main/assets/config.json)

### Troubleshooting:
* **Unable to locate NDK installation** If you have not already installed NDK, follow the instructions at this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk) to do so. Once that is done, NDK should be installed at a path that either looks like `C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Android/ndk/xx.x.xxxxxxx` (Windows) or `/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/xx.x.xxxxxxx` (OSX). Referring to this filepath as `NDK_HOME`, there are two ways to point your project to this filepath: 
  1. Go to **File > Project Structure > SDK Location** and then set the path variable in **Android NDK Location** to `NDK_HOME`.
  2. Open the `local.properties` file and add the following line: `ndk.dir=NDK_HOME`

# Configuration for New RDTs
This repository already includes the files needed to use RDTScan with a few RDT designs that we have encountered during our research:
* [SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f](https://www.alere.com/en/home/product-details/sd-bioline-malaria-ag-pf-hrp-2.html)
* [CareStart Malaria P.f/P.v](http://www.accessbio.net/eng/products/products01_02.asp)
* [Quidel's QuickVue Influenza A+B Test](https://www.quidel.com/immunoassays/rapid-influenza-tests/quickvue-influenza-test)
* [JAL Medical COVID-19](https://www.jalmedical.com/products/covid-19-test-kits/)
* [Wondfo COVID-19](https://en.wondfo.com.cn/product/wondfo-sars-cov-2-antibody-test-lateral-flow-method-2/)

Extending RDTScan to accommodate a new RDT is a matter of three steps: (1) adding a clean photo of the RDT, (2) identifying some regions-of-interest using an image-editing program (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP), and (3) adding that information and other metadata to a configuration file. For detailed instructions on how to extend RDTScan for a new RDT, visit this [link](readme_assets/rdt_configuration.md).

**Note:** RDTScan uses a feature-matching approach to locate the target RDT's design. A detailed explanation of this approach can be found at this [article](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_features_meaning/py_features_meaning.html) by the OpenCV Foundation. As that article explains, feature-matching is less compatable with certain visual characteristics. In the context of RDTs, this includes:
* Blank cassettes with little or no lettering
* Inconsistent patterns (e.g., QR code, bar code)
